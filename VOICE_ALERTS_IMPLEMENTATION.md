### üîä Alert Types
- **Immediate**: Announces each object as it's detected
- **Summary**: Provides periodic summaries of all detected objects
- **Both**: Combines immediate and summary announcements

### ‚öôÔ∏è Voice Customization
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable from 0% to 100%
- **Speech Rate**: Configurable from 0.5x to 2.0x speed
- **Pitch Control**: Adjustable from 0.5x to 2.0x pitch
- **Announcement Details**: Toggle distance and direction information

### üé® User Interface
- **Settings Panel**: Collapsible configuration interface
- **Voice Status Indicator**: Visual feedback in the main interface
- **Test Functionality**: Built-in voice testing capability
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile
